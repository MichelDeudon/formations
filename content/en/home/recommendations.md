> _We would like to express our sincere thanks to Michel who made a very good contribution to this edition, with a presence during the seven days from the beginning to the end of each session while always being available and benevolent towards the students. He managed to add even more motivation to some students, such that they did not want to leave him after that._ - Karim, Volunteer in the GSC association (2022)

> _Having worked together with Michel on data science projets, I can confidently say that he is very competent, passionate about science and a cheerful companion!_ - Titas, Decision Scientist at Vinted (2021)

> _During my final year in high school, Michel helped me a lot in science. He is a tutor with a lot of patience and who knows how to explain in a clear way both mathematics, physics and chemistry. He is pedagogical, and knows how to motivate students. He was able to give me an appetite for mathematics, which was far from won!_ - CÃ©line, BBA student at IE Madrid (2020)

> _The classes were really helpful in the transition from middle school to high school. Thanks to Michel, Jeanne was able to choose the mathematics specialty when at the beginning of the year, she was encountering difficulties. Teaching was adapted and benevolent, based on clear communication._ - Sylvie, Mother of Jeanne (2020)
