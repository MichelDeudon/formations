## Program overview

Learning English is [one of the best investment](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/post/22-03-29-language-learning/) you can make today to become independent. It will give you access to tons of ressources to learn from, bring you work opportunities, and friendships across the world. 

The best way to learn English boils down to three words - <i>"Practice, practice, practice"</i>. In this course, you will have many opportunities to practice with a native American born in New York. It's an opportunity to deepen your vocabulary, grammar and spelling, learn to speak and pronounce words like a native, and an opportunity to expand your culture, including proverbs and American / British history.

Whether you're a beginner or advanced in English, whether you need help with your homework, assignments, tests (Toefl, Toeic), would like to proofread an important document (cover letter, cv, article/blog) or simply want to practice speaking, this program is tailor-made for you.
