Humans are social animals.

## Why study frugal innovation?

Training a single AI model can emit as much carbon as five cars in their lifetimes (...) The most costly model, BERT, had a carbon footprint of roughly 1,400 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent, close to a round-trip trans-America flight for one person. [Technology Review, 2019](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/06/06/239031/training-a-single-ai-model-can-emit-as-much-carbon-as-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/). 

Cloud providers have a conflit of interest (model complexity, BERT).

Popularised ideas, no such things as a universal language model trained on one language (lol)

Lack of diversity (deep learning uses only a fraction of tools available)

Unethical practices (cheap labour, AWS Turk Mechanic, Youtuber moderators, suicides, PhD students, toxic pressure)

Frugal innovation can get us closer to build an inclusive society, low carbon economy

## Applications & audience

- Education, language learning (Duolingo)

## Quiz

{{< spoiler text="What is the difference between lists and tuples?" >}}
Lists

- Lists are mutable - they can be changed
- Slower than tuples
- Syntax: `a_list = [1, 2.0, 'Hello world']`

Tuples

- Tuples are immutable - they can't be changed
- Tuples are faster than lists
- Syntax: `a_tuple = (1, 2.0, 'Hello world')`
