## Why study languages? 

{{< youtube -R6YMWb0vUA >}}

<br> 
Kate Jefferey is a professor in neuroscience at UCL, London, and scientific lead at Exctinction Rebellion. In her inspiring talk on [the psychology of climate inaction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R6YMWb0vUA), language, as a way to communicate with each other and collaborate, has a key role to play to shape our future. <i>With language we have gone further than any species on Earth, we went on the Moon</i>. What if we all started to learn a language with empathy and used language to fix some of our most urgent problems ?

The idea that mankind is a social creature is found in many books. As opposed to the classic theory in economics, in which human beings act rationally, in Dan Ariely's book [Predictibly Irrational](https://predictablyirrational.com/) invites us to question the way Human beings take decisions and make choices. Here again, language has a fundamental role in understanding the hidden forces that shape our decisions. The tragedy of commons has no rational solution. We need to embrace our irrationality to build and envision a better tomorrow.

<b>Computational linguistics</b> is an interdisciplinary field that deals with languages, psychology, social sciences, statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence and more. It has gained in a popularity since the beginning and recently due to the release of datasets, open source libraries, etc. Models in computational linguistics have increased in performance on some tasks (e.g., translation) by using more and more ressources (data, hardware, energy). For comparison, the Human brain only uses 40 Watt. We are at a turn in the way A.I. is taught about. Change in paradigm will affect NLP and computational linguistics.

## Why study frugal innovation?

Training a single AI model can emit as much carbon as five cars in their lifetimes (...) The most costly model, BERT, has a carbon footprint of roughly 1,400 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent, close to a round-trip trans-America flight for one person. [Technology Review, 2019](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/06/06/239031/training-a-single-ai-model-can-emit-as-much-carbon-as-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/). 

Cloud providers have a conflit of interest (model complexity, BERT).

Popularised ideas, no such things as a universal language model trained on one language (lol)

Lack of diversity (deep learning uses only a fraction of tools available)

Unethical practices (cheap labour, AWS Turk Mechanic, Youtuber moderators, suicides, PhD students, toxic pressure)

Frugal innovation can get us closer to build an inclusive society, low carbon economy

## Applications & audience

- Education, language learning (Duolingo)
- Human rights, diversity & inclusion, regulatory, media & political feedback
- Food, music, dnaâ€¦

## Quiz

{{< spoiler text="How many languages are spoken in the world today?" >}}
More than 7000 languages are spoken today, but just 23 languages account for more than half the world's population. Data science, NLP and AI research is majoritarily done in English, introducing in a bias in the way we approach computational linguistics.

{{< spoiler text="True or False, BERT, has a carbon footprint close to a round-trip trans-America flight for one person.?" >}}
True, according to [Technology Review, 2019.](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/06/06/239031/training-a-single-ai-model-can-emit-as-much-carbon-as-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/).
