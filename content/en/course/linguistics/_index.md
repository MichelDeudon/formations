## What you will learn

At the end of the course, participants will be able to {{<hl>}}apply NLP for research or innovative projects{{</hl>}}, compare, explain and choose different methods, as well as question and test hypothesis. Through practical use cases, participants will learn how to use numpy and pandas for data wrangling, matplotlib for data visualization, {{<hl>}}scikit-learn, scipy{{</hl>}} for statistics, ML, linear algebra, {{<hl>}}nltk, spacy{{</hl>}} for NLP tasks ou routines to build simple proof of concepts and MVP.

## FAQs

{{< spoiler text="Are there prerequisites?" >}}
There are no prerequisites for the first course. A computer with Python installed and a Github account is required if you wish to experiment with the use cases. Statistics, maths and python libraries will be introduced along the course with practical use cases.

{{< spoiler text="I followed CS224n at Stanford. Should I attend this course?" >}}
Yes! CS224n is essentially about deep learning which isnâ€™t what this course is about. This course will give you new insights and ways to approach problems.

{{< spoiler text="I worked in computational linguistics and designed simple solutions in the past. Could I share my learnings with you?" >}}
Yes of course! Feel free to reach out to chat and co-create the course. Thanks!
