> <i> You cannot hope to build a better world without improving the individuals. To that end each of us must work for his own improvement, and at the same time share a general responsibility for all humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can be most useful. </i> - Marie Curie, double Nobel laureate (physics and chemistry)

## Program overview

I have been teaching physics and chemistry for 10 years, with passion, patience and empathy, seeking to give to my students the [confidence, intuition and good reflexes](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/p/mathematics/) necessary to become autonomous. In particular, I help my students to ask themselves the right questions to solve problems, to visualize them well, to own them through concrete examples and to develop automatisms to solve exercises more effectively.

My method is very practical. We try, we see where it gets stuck, we discuss. We make sure we won't get stuck in similar situations again. We transform each error to gain in efficiency and effectiveness.
