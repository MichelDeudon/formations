## Chapters overview

In 2017 and 2018, France defined a roadmap for the coming years in artificial intelligence (AI). From the end of 2018 to the end of 2022, alerts followed one another to inform politicians and scientists about the terrible ecological impact of <i>deep learning</i>. Yet, the spotlight during those years was focused on the <i>deep learning</i> godfathers, to the benefit of the United States, GAFAM and NVIDIA.
