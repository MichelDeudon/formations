## Chapters overview

From 2014 to 2018, France defined [a roadmap](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/rapport-villani/) for the coming years in artificial intelligence (AI). From 2018 to 2022, [alerts](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/emma-strubell/) followed one another to inform politicians and scientists about the terrible ecological impact of <i>deep learning</i> in AI.

In August 2021, the <b>Citizen's Climate Convention</b> and 146 proposals were in part translated in the [law n° 2021-1104 on the fight against climate change and strengthening resilience to its effects](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000043956924) of the Code of the Environment. France was sentenced for climate inaction in October 2021 by the administrative court of Paris following the [case of the century](https://www.vie-publique.fr/en-bref/282012-changement-climatique-la-france-condamnee-pour-prejudice-ecologique). <i>The State has an obligation to respect its greenhouse gas emissions reduction trajectory and must repair any overrun by <b>December 31, 2022</b>. Each departure from the road on the climate trajectory now constitutes a fault which MUST be repaired</i>.

After a [heat record in France](https://meteofrance.com/actualites-et-dossiers/actualites/2022-annee-la-plus-chaude-en-france) in 2022 and in a context of energy crisis and war in Europe, the winter 2023 was marked by a [drought record in France](https://meteofrance.com/actualites-et-dossiers/actualites/climat/secheresse-32-jours-sans-pluie-en-france-record-battu) and energy consumption records with ChatGPT3, LLaMA from Facebook AI Research (FAIR Paris), ChatGPT4... for the benefit of a few French engineers and investors.

In this course, you will learn how to spot [greenwashing, conflicts of interest](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/greenwashing/), fake news and fight against disinformation by [reinvesting your time, energy and attention in sustainable development](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/pratique/).
