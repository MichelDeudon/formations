## Chapters overview

From 2014 to 2018, France defined [a roadmap](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/rapport-villani/) for the coming years in artificial intelligence (AI). From 2018 to 2022, [alerts](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/emma-strubell/) followed one another to inform politicians and scientists about the terrible ecological impact of <i>deep learning</i> in AI.

France was sentenced for climate inaction in October 2021 by the administrative court of Paris following the case of the century.
After a [heat record in France](https://meteofrance.com/actualites-et-dossiers/actualites/2022-annee-la-plus-chaude-en-france) in 2022 and in a context of energy crisis and war in Europe, the winter 2023 was marked by a [drought record in France](https://meteofrance.com/actualites-et-dossiers/actualites/climat/secheresse-32-jours-sans-pluie-en-france-record-battu) and energy consumption records with ChatGPT3 of Open AI (co-founded by Elon Musk), LLaMA from Facebook AI Research (FAIR Paris), ChatGPT4... for the benefit of a few French engineers and investors.

In this course, you will learn how to spot [greenwashing, conflicts of interest](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/greenwashing/), fake news and fight against disinformation by reinvesting your time, energy and attention in sustainable development.
