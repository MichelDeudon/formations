French spring and summer without social networks.

<!--more-->

## 1. Take care of your physical and mental health üéóÔ∏è

To fight disinformation and put an end to the viral circulation of toxic information, you must above all not comment or share false news or hateful messages (because more reactions, more views, more virulence...). Report/block these messages, quit the application, or better <b>deactivate/delete your account</b> and <b>turn off your screen</b> during the Spring/Summer 2023.

Stop procrastinating on social media, especially during elections or exams. Find here instructions to deactivate or delete your account on [Instagram](https://help.instagram.com/370452623149242), [Facebook](https: //www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674), [Whatsapp](https://faq.whatsapp.com/2138577903196467/), [Twitter](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-deactivate-twitter-account), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1379064/close-your-linkedin-account?lang=en).. [ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6378407-how-can-i-delete-my-account).

Prefer a phone call to communicate with your beloved, rather than Meta messaging services.

Ask for help if needed. <br>

## 2. Obtain information from reliable sources

Exercise <b>discernment</b> and <b>critical thinking</b>. Prioritize quality over quantity.

Be attentive to [conflicts of interest and greenwashing](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/greenwashing/), biases and what is left unsaid. Where does the money come from? What is the goal? What numbers are not reported? Who is invisibilised? For example, you can follow [M√©t√©o France](https://meteofrance.com/actualites-et-dossiers/actualites/climat/secheresse-32-jours-sans-pluie-en-france-record-battu) and [the CNRS](https://lejournal.cnrs.fr/articles/climatosceptiques-sur-twitter-enquete-sur-les-mercenaires-de-lintox), or independant medias such as [Blast](https://www.blast-info.fr/articles/2023/sommes-nous-toujours-en-democratie-AwJ1_TmlTM-ONwHybrhuqQ) and [Mediapart](https://www.mediapart.fr/).

<b>Call for contribution</b>: Co-create this [course on disinformation](https://www.mtpcours.fr/c/desinformation/). Create and share content (interviews, testimonials), visuals, an incentive approach to attract young people (impact by participation and total).

## 3. Refocus attention in society

Destigmatize addictions to social networks, [depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN3D0uLEERU&ab_channel=GDGFrance). Talk about mental health, emotions, student precariousness, eco-anxiety... about the use of public money, the [redistribution of wealth](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/rapport-villani/), our relationship to work, the ecological emergency.

Learn to meditate, concentrate, be more present and grateful, for example with [Petit Bambou](https://www.lajauneetlarouge.com/petit-bambou-lappli-de-meditation-cofondee-par-un-polytechnicien/).

<b>Call for contribution</b>: [Testify](https://annuel2.framapad.org/p/reseaux-sociaux-sante-mentale-a0fk?lang=en), social networks and mental health.

## 4. Make sense of the future

Invest your time/energy on the long term. [Learn a language](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/post/22-03-29-language-learning/), cook, do crafts... sports, play music, volunteer. Get out of your comfort zone. Rewrite the future with [new narratives](https://www.lajauneetlarouge.com/potamai-energie-autonomie-et-resilience-pour-les-femmes-africaines/), a solidarity Summer, without social networks.

## 5. Support local innovations ‚ú®

Frugal, solidarity, social, low-tech, agroecology, ecologistics, biomimicry, independent media, ecological redirection... Act locally (non profits, press, conferences, events...).
