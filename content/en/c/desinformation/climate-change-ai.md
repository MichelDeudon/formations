The original article is published on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05433v1) on June 10, 2019, four days after [Emma Strubell](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243) and the [MIT](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/06/06/239031/training-a-single-ai-model-can-emit-as-much-carbon-as-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/)'s alert in 2019. It is republished on June 7 February 2022 by the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485128) (ACM) which awards the Turing Prize. In December 2022, while Yann Lecun and Elon Musk are working on models with billions of parameters (1000 times [MIT](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/06/06/239031/training-a-single-ai-model-can-emit-as-much-carbon-as-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/)'s 2019 alert), a workshop is organized by climatechange.ai at [NeurIPS 2022](https://www.climatechange.ai/events/neurips2022) and includes 19 authors from <b style='color:blue;'>NVIDIA</b> which benefits from the explosion of model complexity.
