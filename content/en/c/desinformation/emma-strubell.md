## [Energy and Policy Considerations for Deep Learning in NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243)

üö® On June 5, 2019, Emma Strubell, PhD candidate and lead author of the paper [Energy and Policy Considerations for Deep Learning in NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243) gave the alert to the scientific and political community of the terrible ecological impact of deep learning models in linguistics at that time. Her article appeared in <b>ACL2019</b> üáÆüáπ, the largest linguistics conference. The <b>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b> üá∫üá∏ shared her alert on energy consumption and carbon emissions of models with millions of parameters like [Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (<b>Google</b>, 2017) and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) (<b>Google</b>, 2018) in its technology review of June 6, 2019. At that time, the largest model had up to 65 million parameters (1/1000 [LLaMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971), 2023).

6 juin 2019. [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/06/06/239031/training-a-single-ai-model-can-emit-as-much-carbon-as-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/) by Karen Hao.

The [artificial-intelligence](https://www.technologyreview.com/artificial-intelligence/) industry is often compared to the oil industry: once mined and refined, data, like oil, can be a highly lucrative commodity. Now it seems the metaphor may extend even further. Like its fossil-fuel counterpart, the process of {{<hl>}}<b>deep learning has an outsize environmental impact</b>{{</hl>}}.

In a [new paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02243), researchers at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, performed a life cycle assessment for training several common large AI models. They found that the process can emit more than 626,000 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent‚Äînearly five times the lifetime emissions of the average American car (and that includes manufacture of the car itself). What's more, the researchers note that the figures should only be considered as baselines. ‚Äú<b>Training a single model is the minimum amount of work you can do</b>," says <b>Emma Strubell</b>, a PhD candidate at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and the lead author of the paper. In practice, it's much more likely that AI researchers would develop a new model from scratch or adapt an existing model to a new data set, either of which can require many more rounds of training and tuning.

### The carbon footprint of natural-language processing
The paper specifically examines the model training process for [natural-language processing](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612975/ai-natural-language-processing-explained/) (NLP), the subfield of AI that focuses on teaching machines to handle human language. In the last two years, the NLP community has reached several noteworthy performance milestones in machine translation, sentence completion, and other standard benchmarking tasks. [OpenAI's infamous GPT-2 model](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612960/an-ai-tool-auto-generates-fake-news-bogus-tweets-and-plenty-of-gibberish/), as one example, excelled at writing convincing fake news articles. But such advances have required <b>training ever larger models on sprawling data sets of sentences scraped from the internet. The approach is computationally expensive‚Äîand highly energy intensive</b>.

The researchers looked at four models in the field that have been responsible for the biggest leaps in performance: the Transformer, ELMo, [BERT](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/18/technology/artificial-intelligence-language.html), and GPT-2. They trained each on a single GPU for up to a day to measure its power draw. They then used the number of training hours listed in the model‚Äôs original papers to calculate the total energy consumed over the complete training process. That number was converted into pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent based on the average energy mix in the US, which closely matches the energy mix used by <b>Amazon‚Äôs AWS</b>, the largest cloud services provider.

### The estimated costs of training a model once
In practice, models are usually trained many times during research and development. They found that <b>the computational and environmental costs of training grew proportionally to model size and then exploded when additional tuning steps were used to increase the model‚Äôs final accuracy</b>.

Strubell and her colleagues used a model they‚Äôd produced in a previous paper as a case study. They found that the process of building and testing a final paper-worthy model required training 4,789 models over a six-month period. Converted to CO2 equivalent, it emitted more than 78,000 pounds and is likely representative of typical work in the field.

The significance of those figures is colossal‚Äîespecially when considering the current trends in AI research. ‚Äú<i>This kind of analysis needed to be done to raise awareness about the resources being spent [...] and will spark a debate</i>.‚Äù, says <b>G√≥mez-Rodr√≠guez</b>. ‚Äú<i>What probably many of us did not comprehend is the scale of it until we saw these comparisons</i>,‚Äù echoed <b>Siva Reddy</b>, a postdoc at <b>Stanford University</b> who was not involved in the research.

### The privatization of AI research
The results underscore another growing problem in AI, too: <b>the sheer intensity of resources now required to produce paper-worthy results</b> has made it increasingly challenging for people working in academia to continue contributing to research. ‚Äú<b>This trend toward training huge models on tons of data is not feasible for academics</b> ‚Äî grad students especially, because we don‚Äôt have the computational resources,‚Äù says Strubell. ‚ÄúSo there‚Äôs <b>an issue of equitable access</b> between researchers in academia versus researchers in industry.‚Äù
