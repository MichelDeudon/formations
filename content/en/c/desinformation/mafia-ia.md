French spring and summer without social networks.

To fight disinformation, you have to <b>invest your time and energy</b> in other ways, in the <b>long term</b>.

## 1. Stop procrastinating on social networks

To put an end to the virulent circulation of toxic information, you must above all not comment on or share false news or hateful messages (because more reactions, more views, more virulence...). Report/block these messages, quit the app, or better disable/delete his account and turn off his screen. During review periods and election periods, it is all the more important to limit your time on social networks.

Prefer a phone call or text message, rather than Meta messaging services to communicate with your loved ones, and be more present. This approach was not proposed by the more than 1,700 signatories of the open letter to pause giant AI experiments, led by Elon Musk (owner of the Twitter network and cofounder of OpenAI). Yet it is the strongest signal that can be sent to investors and researchers in the world of AI.

## 2. Obtain information from reliable sources, exercise discernment and critical thinking

Be attentive to conflicts of interest and greenwashing (in R&D, health, media, etc.), biases, and things left unsaid. Where does the money come from? What is the point? What numbers are not reported? Who is forgotten or invisible? For example, you can find out about [Météo France](https://meteofrance.com/actualites-et-dossiers/actualites/climat/secheresse-32-jours-sans-pluie-en-france-record-battu) and [the CNRS](https://lejournal.cnrs.fr/articles/climatosceptiques-sur-twitter-enquete-sur-les-mercenaires-de-lintox).

## 3. Refocus societal attention and debates

De-stigmatize social media addiction. Talking about the mental health of young people, depression, student precariousness, eco-anxiety... the use of public money, the redistribution of wealth, the relationship to work, the ecological emergency.

## 4. Reinvest your time to form a company

- Learn a language, cook, do crafts… get out of your comfort zone.
- Playing sports, volunteering, crafts...
- Create and share content (popularization, interviews/testimonials, etc.). Visuals and an incentive approach to attract young audiences (quantify CO2 by participation and total). Show the benefits of taking a break.

## 5. Donner du sens à l’avenir et réécrire le futur

- Donner l’impulsion de nouveaux imaginaires par exemple à l’occasion de l’été sans réseaux sociaux (1ere édition à organiser)
- Proposer des alternatives pour un été solidaire, d’amour, d’entraide…
- Soutenez une cause par vos actions (égalité des chances, justice sociale, justice climatique…)

## 6. Support real innovations

Support frugal innovations, lowtech, agroecology, ecologistics, biomimicry, independent medias, reconversions, ecological redirection...

Participate/get involved in local conferences or events.
