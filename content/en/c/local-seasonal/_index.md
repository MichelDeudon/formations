## Presentation

Local Seasonal is a [French non profit](https://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/associations/detail-annonce/associations_b/20200022/840) on a mission to celebrate biodiversity along the seasons, create social ties, reconnect with Nature and between us, by creating places and moments of sharing, promoting collective development and harmonious exchanges. The non profit seeks to apply the principles of permaculture: taking care of people, taking care of the earth and sharing equitably.
