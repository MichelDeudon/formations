## Presentation

GAFAM and social networks deepen social inequalities, and divide to conquer. Another vision of the world exists, <i>"one that unites"</i> - Paul Val√©ry.

The trainings offered helps young people and those around them to express themselves and be informed on social networks, in a caring environment, to discover methods of debate, attentive listening and collective intelligence, and to seek alternatives, to fight against social inequalities, discriminations and online violence.

Developed in Montpellier with and for middle school and high school students, parents, students in higher education and research, healthcare, solidarity and national education professionals, they do not assume any prerequisites and adapt to your needs. For any questions or to schedule a training session, contact Mich.
