This training, in the form of a collaborative and interactive workshop, is built around 3 stages.

<!--more-->

1. Introduction.
2. Putting the 1-2-4-all method into practice to debate: What needs do social networks meet? How do they make me feel? What alternatives exist? What are concrete solutions?
3. Testimonials from people who have tried to limit their use of social networks, or who have freed themselves from them.

At the end of the workshop, in a process of continuous improvement, participants are invited to summarize what they liked (or not) and learned.
