Hi! My name is Michel, pronounced Michael in English, and I'm born in New York. I worked in Berlin, London, San Francisco, Montréal and Tokyo, lived more than 10 years abroad and I'm passionate about teaching, learning languages, psychology and rollerblading!

Since 2012, I mentor people and offer my services as a private teacher, coach or volunteer for parents, non profits or organizations, from primary school to high school and higher education. I offer reskilling and upskilling opportunities for adults in companies and start-ups - on data science, data protection, frugal innovation and computational linguistics, etc.

I graduated from Polytechnique in 2017 and presented novel methods in operations research and linguistics at international conferences in 2018 (CPAIOR and Neurips). I worked at Accenture, ElementAI, with ESA and at Vinted as a research engineer / senior data scientist, as well as non profits in France, Italy and the UK in various roles. My work was featured in [CNES's spacegate](https://spacegate.cnes.fr/fr/covid-19-venise-sans-les-bateaux) and received 3 ESA prizes with some colleagues. I had an opportunity to mentor PhD students at NASA FDL in 2019 and facilitate a thesis for France's General Secretariat for Defence and National Security in 2021. Since 2020, I am also co-president of [Local Seasonal](https://www.local-seasonal.org/en/), a French non profit to celebrate diversity along the seasons.
