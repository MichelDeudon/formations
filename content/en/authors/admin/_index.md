Since 2012, I train, support and mentor talents. I offer my services as a private teacher, mentor, coach or volunteer with parents, non profits or governmental organizations for primary school to high school and higher education. I offer reskilling and upskilling opportunities for adults in companies and start-ups in the social and solidarity economy - on the protection of personal data, innovation, data science, in interdisciplinary fields or specific domains (health, space , food, 2nd hand).

<br>

I am a graduate of Polytechnique and the College of Engineers. My support and my quality approach are tailor-made. I draw from design thinking, co-creation at Vinted and ElementAI, collaborations with universities and non profits in Canada, Japan, the UK, the US, good practices and lessons to create long-term value.

<br>

I'm also co-president of Local Seasonal, co-founder of Binet Soupe and passionate about extreme sports.
