Hi! I'm Michael, I was born in New York, I'm passionate about ecology and psychology. I teach [English](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/english/) and [science](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/physique-chimie/), in high school and higher education since 2012. In 2020, I co-founded [Local Seasonal](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/local-seasonal/), a French non profit to celebrate diversity along the seasons. Since 2022, I teach in Montpellier and co-create preventive workshops on [social media](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/reseaux/) and [disinformation](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/). In my spare time, I like to dance, [rollerblade](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/p/roller-dance-montpellier/) and enjoy outdoor activities.
