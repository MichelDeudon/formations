Hi! I'm Michael, I was born in New York, I'm passionate about ecology and psychology. I teach English and science, in high school and higher education since 2012. I also offer reskilling opportunities for adults in ecolinguistics and frugal innovation. In 2020, I co-founded [Local Seasonal](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/local-seasonal/), a French non profit to celebrate diversity along the seasons. Since 2022-2023 I teach in Montpellier, at the [PierresVives Media Library](https://pierresvives.herault.fr/126-mediatheque-pierresvives.htm), with the non profit [Générations Solidaires et Citoyennes](https://www.jeveuxaider.gouv.fr/organisations/4859-generations-solidaires-et-citoyennes) and at the [Humanities faculty](https://www.univ-montp3.fr/). In my spare time, I like to dance, rollerblade and enjoy outdoor activities.
