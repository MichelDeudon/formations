Hi! I'm Michael, I was born in New York and lived more than 10 years abroad. I'm passionate about teaching, learning and psychology. I mentor students in English, science and mathematics, in high school and higher education since 2012. I also offer reskilling and upskilling opportunities for adults - in data science, data protection, innovation, etc. I worked at Accenture, ElementAI, with ESA and at Vinted as a senior data scientist, as well as non profits in various roles. In 2020 with Lucie, we co-founded [Local Seasonal](https://www.local-seasonal.org/en/), a French non profit to celebrate diversity along the seasons. In my spare time, I like to dance, rollerblade and enjoy outdoor activities.
