Hi! I'm Michael, I was born in New York. I teach [mathematics](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/maths/), [physics-chemistry](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/physics-chemistry/) and [English](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/english/) in high school and higher education. I have been teaching in Montpellier since 2022, at the [Paul Val√©ry](https://www.univ-montp3.fr/) university (contractual in 2022/23) and with the [association GSC](https://www.helloasso.com/associations/generations-solidaires-et-citoyennes) in La Mosson. I run preventive workshops on [social networks](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/reseaux/) and I offer [academic support](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/p/soutien-scolaire-maths-montpellier/). In the past, I worked in social reintegration in La Reunion (2014), as a research engineer at Element AI in London (2019) and as a data scientist at Vinted in Berlin (2021). I received three awards from the European Space Agency (ESA) with colleagues and I mentored researchers in California before joining the [d√©sert'heureuses](https://desertheureuses.noblogs.org/). I co-founded the Binet Soupe in 2015 and in 2020 a non profit to celebrate diversity [along the seasons](https://www.mtpcours.fr/c/local-seasonal/). I like dancing, [rollerblading](https://www.mtpcours.fr/p/roller-dance-montpellier/) and outdoor activities.
