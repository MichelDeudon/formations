Since 2012, I train, support and mentor talents. I offer my services as a private teacher, mentor, coach or volunteer for parents, non profits or governmental organizations, from primary school to high school and higher education. I offer reskilling and upskilling opportunities for adults in companies and start-ups - on the protection of personal data, innovation, data science, interdisciplinary fields or specific domains (health, space, food, 2nd hand).

I am a graduate of Polytechnique and the College des ingénieurs. I worked at Vinted, ElementAI, and collaborated with universities in Canada, Japan, the US and the UK, as well as non profits in various roles. I'm a co-president of Local Seasonal, a French non profit to celebrate diversity along the seasons and passionate about roller dance.
