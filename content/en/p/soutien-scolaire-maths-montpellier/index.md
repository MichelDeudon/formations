## The advantages of academic support

- A personalized assessment and educational follow-up.

## Program

### Individual rates (group of 5 max)

| Session | Month | Quarter |
|---|---|---|
| 1h30 | 4 sessions | 10 sessions |
| 15‚Ç¨ | 50‚Ç¨ | 120‚Ç¨ or 12 hours of tutoring |

The objective of tutoring is to encourage mutual assistance and the idea of teaching to learn (Feynman method), or to train trainers, to perpetuate the school support action in the long term. It allows more modest families to benefit from a reduction over the quarter, for example ‚Ç¨30 for 3 hours of tutoring (2 CLAS sessions to be co-facilitated as a back-up volunteer). Finally, the academic support and tutoring program aims to give more autonomy to young people, allowing them, in turn, to pass on what they have learned.
