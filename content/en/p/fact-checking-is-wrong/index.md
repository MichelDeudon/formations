It's a symptom of a social and ecological emergency

The ecole Polytechnique, created in en 1794, is tied to the history of the French Revolution. With a budget of â‚¬192 million in 2019, the Court of Auditors wrote in February 2020

> <i>Ã‰cole Polytechnique: an uncertain strategy, management to be rectified</i>. [2020 annualÂ report](https://www.ccomptes.fr/system/files/2020-02/20200225-12-TomeI-ecole-polytechnique.pdf).

Because of Covid-19 and lockdowns, no public debate really took place on what should be Polytechnique's mission in the 21th century.

## Disinformation is used to divert attention, divide andÂ conquer

In March 2023, Olivier VÃ©ran, Macron's Minister of Health appointed during the Covid-19 crisis, compared France historical social movement on March 7 to <i>"an ecological disaster"</i> ðŸ˜·. GÃ©rald Darmanin, Macron's Minister of the Interior, compared his opponents on the left wing to <i>"terrorists"</i> after the executive duo Macron/Borne (X81) used the article 49.3 of the Constitution to force a reform through Parliament without a vote, for the 100th time of the fifth Republic.

## Fact checking isÂ outdated

- Fact checking is not new, disinformation is originally caused by Humans, Presidents, Ministers... (not AI)
- Fact checking is a binary vision, 0/1, true/false... outdated by quantum physicsÂ¸, the idea that two contradictory ideas can be true simulatenously and social progress. Plus, [some questions require to debate](https://www.blast-info.fr/articles/2023/sommes-nous-toujours-en-democratie-AwJ1_TmlTM-ONwHybrhuqQ).Â 
- Fact checking of viral messages diverts attention from key findings, like [Emma Strubell](https://www.mtpcours.fr/c/desinformation/emma-strubell/)'s article in 2019 or [Servane Mouton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUZpHO9JXbE&ab_channel=ComprendreetAgir)'s talk in 2023.
- Fact checking puts voices under silence. It paves the way to censorship. See [AREVA / MAUREEN KEARNEY CASE: BACK ON A STATE SCANDAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRyriD9iLZY&ab_channel=BLAST%2CLesouffledel%27info).

What don't we don't know to debate?

## Technology and HumanÂ intents

{{< figure src="fact-checking/Lecun-disinformation.png" caption="Science is used by <i>'leaders'</i> to create disinformation, divert attention, divide and conquer in politics.">}}

Since Google's 2017 paper <i>attention is all you need</i>, Meta AI, Open AIâ€¦ use and rename, and reuse and rename the same model, consuming in 2022/2023 more energy at a higher price, as a competitive advantage with publicly funded French research.

Are <i>state-of-the-art, outperforming, competitive</i> models better for society?

The Turing award Yann Le Cun and 7 polytechniciens in France trained <i>large language models</i> for Facebook / InstagramÂ during the Winter 2022/2023 energy and social crisis...

The models <i>consumed a massive quantity of energy, responsible for the emission of carbon dioxide</i> (source: Arxiv). They have <i>billions of parameters</i>, for <i>billions of people</i> (source: Meta AI blog). <i>Risks and harms include the generation of harmful, offensive or biased contentâ€¦ incorrect information</i>. (source: Github Model Card).

## Open review questions

{{< figure src="fact-checking/facebook-cifre.png">}}

- Why is the French CIFRE system used to create sexism, racism and disinformation at MetaÂ ?
- Why are the [energy consumption](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/emma-strubell/) and models' risks/harms, leak, ethical concerns, not communicated clearly on Meta AI's blog or on social networks?
- Why does Meta AI use [greenwashing](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/greenwashing/) techniques (e.g., smaller, smallest), in its research blog and on social networks (Linkedin, Twitter)Â ?Â 

## Call toÂ Action

The World faces an economic, ecologic and social crisis, while recording historical climate eventsâ€Š-â€Š[record heatwaves](https://meteofrance.com/actualites-et-dossiers/actualites/2022-annee-la-plus-chaude-en-france) in 2022, [32 days without rain](https://meteofrance.com/actualites-et-dossiers/actualites/climat/secheresse-32-jours-sans-pluie-en-france-record-battu) in 2023.
