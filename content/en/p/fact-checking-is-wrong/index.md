It's a symptom of a social and ecological emergency

<!--more-->

Ecole Polytechnique, <i>the leading French science & technology institution</i> according to social networks, was co-founded in 1794 by the mathematician Gaspard Monge, during the French Revolution 🇫🇷. It was later militarized under Napoleon in 1804.

Macron, France's Minister of the Economy and Digital in 2014, was first elected President and therefore <i>head of the army</i> in 2017. His party for the Presidential campain, La République en Marche, had a mathematician and French Fields Medal as MP for Essonne (where Polytechnique is), Cédric Villani, known like Gaspard Monge for his seminal work on Optimal Transport.

[Re-evaluating Word Mover's Distance](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/sato22b.html). ICML 2022.">}}

A year later, in 2018, Eric Labaye (X87), senior partner at [McKinsey](https://www.bpifrance.fr/nos-actualites/rencontres-economiques-daix-en-provence-un-regard-sur-le-monde-demain), was appointed executive President of Polytechnique and later President of the newly created Institut Polytechnique de Paris.

Jacques Biot (X71), Polytechnique's previous executive President, joined Huawei with the head of the Paris-Saclay Center for Data Science.

The divorce between Polytechnique and the University Paris-Saclay, the USA and China was [announced by Macron in 2017](https://www.lemonde.fr/campus/article/2017/10/25/emmanuel-macron-met-fin-au-projet-de-pole-universitaire-et-scientifique-unique-a-saclay_5205975_4401467.html), the year of his first election.

## Polytechnique is a symbolic French institution

Polytechnique is tied to the history of the French Revolution. With a budget of €192 million in 2019, the Court of Auditors wrote in February 2020

> <i>École Polytechnique: an uncertain strategy, management to be rectified</i>. [2020 annual report](https://www.ccomptes.fr/system/files/2020-02/20200225-12-TomeI-ecole-polytechnique.pdf).

Because of Covid-19 and lockdowns, no public debate really took place on what should be Polytechnique's mission in the 21th century.

Macron's [McKinseyGate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ciN_0BNOzQ&ab_channel=BLAST%2CLesouffledel%27info) was disclosed in 2022.

Villani left Macron and joined France's ecological party for the 2022 election. The second round opposed Le Pen (Rassemblement National) to Macron, leading to the creation of the New Union of Popular, Ecological and Social parties (NUPES).

A year later, in March 2023, Olivier Véran, Macron's Minister of Health appointed during the Covid-19 crisis, compared France historical social movement on March 7 to <i>"an ecological disaster"</i> 😷. Gérald Darmanin, Macron's Minister of the Interior, compared his opponents on the left wing to <i>"terrorists"</i> after the executive duo Macron/Borne (X81) used the article 49.3 of the Constitution to force a reform through Parliament without a vote, for the 100th time of the fifth Republic.

## Disinformation is used to divert attention, divide and conquer

In an interview in le Monde, on March 28, 2018, the French Medal Fields [Cédric Villani](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/rapport-villani/) said <i>"AI cannot be a new machine to exclude"</i>.

With women representing 10% of French computer science engineering schools, Villani recommended an <i>"incentive policy"</i> aimed at achieving a rate of 40% of female students by 2020. As he wrote in his report, <i>"this lack of diversity can lead algorithms to reproduce biases"</i>.

Racism, sexism and social risks are mentioned in his 2018 report, as well as <i>"new methods of production and distribution of value"</i>. More broadly, the MP recommended the establishment of an AI ethics committee, responsible for organizing public debate and providing opinions and recommendations <i>"in complete independence"</i>. 

Yet, in 2023, Polytechnique keeps disinforming people. [This article](https://www.lajauneetlarouge.com/ia-de-confiance-enjeux-et-solutions-pour-un-traitement-ethique-des-donnees/) by Vincent Luciani (X05) highlights obvious conflicts of interest (Artefact, the AI Infrastructure Alliance, the MLOps Community). Related articles by Alain (X79), Didier (X82), David (X97), Thierry (X84), Robert (X72), Gérard (X67), Paul... underline a lack of diversity at Polytechnique and biases in opinions (all authors are white male, between 38 and 80 years old). 

I remember, at the time when I studied at Polytechnique, <i>leaders</i> were invited to inspire us. Carlos Ghosn was invited a few months before ending in prison. The French billionaire Patrick Drahi gave his name to Polytechnique's center for entrepreneurship and innovation, today he's publicly known for his scams and the [DrahiLeaks](https://www.blast-info.fr/articles/2023/drahileaks-la-methode-de-patrick-drahi-pour-devenir-riche-P5NfCE1qRt6QgwnJRKpMtA).

Polytechnique's management [to be rectified](https://www.ccomptes.fr/system/files/2020-02/20200225-12-TomeI-ecole-polytechnique.pdf) the Court of Auditors wrote in 2020. What has been done since?

In [another interview](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/rapport-villani/#excerpts-from-ai-is-everyones-businesshttpswwwlemondefrpixelsarticle20170909cedric-villani-l-intelligence-artificielle-est-l-affaire-de-tout-le-monde_5183163_4408996html) in Le Monde in September 2017, Villani talks about Putin, law and revolution, as well as World War III and Elon Musk's business model. The privatization of AI research is mentionned, Yann Le Cun, Macron… Google, Amazon, Facebook, Europe, governance problems.

## The deeptech bubble bursted

Deep tech is promoted by Yann Le Cun (French <i>"godfather"</i> of AI), Cédric Labaye (President of Polytechnique), Bruno Le Maire (French minister of the Economy)… Emmanuel Macron.

The number of unicorns in France (startup valued a 1 billion plus euro) is a misleading KPI 🦄.

It creates more inequalities and puts at risk women and ethnic groups.

Bots and fake profiles could spread viral messages on social networks, but the artificially generated bubble started to burst. 

Silicon Valley Bank shut down in February 2023, five years after [Villani's report](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/rapport-villani/). UBS acquired the Crédit Suisse 🇨🇭 to avoid bankruptcy.

People are disinformed in the short term, but a scientific principle never stays secret.

Disinformation and repression don't generate long term value.

## Fact checking is outdated

- It is a binary vision, 0/1, true/false... outdated by quantum physics and the idea that two contradictory ideas can be true simulatenously. Plus, [some questions require to debate](https://www.blast-info.fr/articles/2023/sommes-nous-toujours-en-democratie-AwJ1_TmlTM-ONwHybrhuqQ). 
- Fact checking of viral messages diverts attention from key findings, like Emma Strubell's article [Energy and Policy Considerations for Deep Learning in NLP](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/emma-strubell/).
- Fact checking puts voices under silence. It paves the way to censorship. See [AREVA / MAUREEN KEARNEY CASE: BACK ON A STATE SCANDAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRyriD9iLZY&ab_channel=BLAST%2CLesouffledel%27info).

What don't we don't know to debate?

## Technology and Human intents

French medias and social networks are owned by billionaires. The Government is controlled by a [French Mafia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EveWWX3fB2M&ab_channel=BLAST%2CLesouffledel%27info). AI Research is owned by GAFAM and NVIDIA.

In game theory, if people seek to maximize their individual profit and perceive ecology as a cost rather than a value, nobody in the above groupe has an interest in seriously addressing  climate change.

{{< figure src="fact-checking/Lecun-disinformation.png" caption="Science is used by <i>'leaders'</i> to create disinformation, divert attention, divide and conquer in politics.">}}

Since Google's 2017 paper <i>attention is all you need</i>, Meta AI, Open AI… use and rename, and reuse and rename the same model, consuming in 2022/2023 more energy at a higher price, as a competitive advantage with publicly funded French research.

An arxiv from 2019 shows written evidence Facebook offered a gift to Paul Michel (X13), a French polytechnicien at Carnegie Mellon (now at Deep Mind), to miscommunicate on science at NeurIPS 2019.

Are state-of-the-art, outperforming, competitive models better for society? 

Certainly not.

The share of women in Maths in high school in France [dropped below 1994 level](https://www.letudiant.fr/lycee/infographies-comment-la-reforme-du-lycee-penalise-les-filles.html) under Macron.

## Open review questions

Yann Le Cun and 7 polytechniciens in France (Hugo Touvron, Thibaut Lavril, Gautier Izacard, Xavier Martinet, Armand Joulin, Edouard Grave, Guillaume Lample) trained <i>large language models</i> for Facebook / Instagram during the Winter 2022/2023 energy and social crisis. 

{{< figure src="fact-checking/facebook-cifre.png">}}

The models <i>consumed a massive quantity of energy, responsible for the emission of carbon dioxide</i> (source: Arxiv). They have <i>billions of parameters</i>, for <i>billions of people</i> (source: Meta AI blog). <i>Risks and harms include the generation of harmful, offensive or biased content… incorrect information</i>. (source: Github Model Card).
- Why is the French CIFRE system used to create disinformation for Meta and compete with Elon Musk's ChatGPT ?
- Why are the [energy consumption](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/emma-strubell/) and models' risks/harms, leak, ethical concerns, not communicated clearly on Meta AI's blog or on social networks?
- Why does Meta AI use [greenwashing](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/greenwashing/) techniques (e.g., smaller, smallest), in its research blog and on social networks (Linkedin, Twitter) ? 

## Call to Action

The World faces an economic, ecologic and social crisis, while recording historical climate events - [record heatwaves](https://meteofrance.com/actualites-et-dossiers/actualites/2022-annee-la-plus-chaude-en-france) in 2022, [32 days without rain](https://meteofrance.com/actualites-et-dossiers/actualites/climat/secheresse-32-jours-sans-pluie-en-france-record-battu) in 2023.

Macron made VivaTech his signature event 🦄.

Here's what you can do

1. Prepare and ask your questions for Vivatech (June 14–17, 2023).
2. Take a pause from social networks this Spring/Summer to [take care of your physical and mental health](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/pratique/) 🎗️, and beloved, planet.
3. Stayed informed about [disinformation](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/) on my course.
