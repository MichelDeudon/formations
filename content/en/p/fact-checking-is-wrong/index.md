It's a symptom of a social and ecological emergency

<!--more-->

Ecole Polytechnique, <i>the leading French science & technology institution</i> according to social networks, was co-founded in 1794 by the mathematician Gaspard Monge 🥖, during the French Revolution 🇫🇷. It was later militarized under Napoleon in 1804.

Macron, France's Minister of the Economy and Digital in 2014, was first elected President and therefore <i>head of the army</i> in 2017. His party for the Presidential campain, La République en Marche, had a mathematician and French Fields Medal as MP for Essonne (where Polytechnique is), Cédric Villani, known like Gaspard Monge for his seminal work on Optimal Transport.

[Re-evaluating Word Mover's Distance](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/sato22b.html). ICML 2022.">}}

A year later, in 2018, Eric Labaye (X87), senior partner at [McKinsey & Company](https://www.bpifrance.fr/nos-actualites/rencontres-economiques-daix-en-provence-un-regard-sur-le-monde-demain), was appointed executive President of Polytechnique and later President of the newly created Institut Polytechnique de Paris.

Jacques Biot (X71), Polytechnique's previous executive President, joined Huawei with the head of the Paris-Saclay Center for Data Science.

The divorce between Polytechnique and the University Paris-Saclay, the USA and China was [announced by Macron in 2017](https://www.lemonde.fr/campus/article/2017/10/25/emmanuel-macron-met-fin-au-projet-de-pole-universitaire-et-scientifique-unique-a-saclay_5205975_4401467.html), the year of his first election.

## Polytechnique is a symbolic French institution

Polytechnique is tied to the history of the French Revolution. With a budget of €192 million in 2019, the Court of Auditors wrote in February 2020

> <i>École Polytechnique: an uncertain strategy, management to be rectified</i>. [2020 annual report](https://www.ccomptes.fr/system/files/2020-02/20200225-12-TomeI-ecole-polytechnique.pdf).

Macron's [McKinseyGate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ciN_0BNOzQ&ab_channel=BLAST%2CLesouffledel%27info) was disclosed in 2022.

Yet, after Macron asked French citizens to reduce their individual energy consumption by 10% in September 2022, in the context of an energy crisis in Europe, 7 polytechniciens in Paris, co-authored one of Facebook's largest artificial intelligence model in February 2023, requiring [449 MWh to train a single model](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/emma-strubell/) on NVIDIA hardware.

<i>Training a single model is the minimum amount of work you can do (…) This trend toward training huge models on tons of data is not feasible for academics. There's an issue of equitable access between researchers in academia versus researchers in industry.</i> - Emma Strubell, lead author of the paper [Energy and Policy Considerations for Deep Learning in NLP](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/emma-strubell/).

Two weeks later, on March 7, 2023, France went on a historical strike and ten days later, the executive duo Macron/Borne (X81) used the article 49.3 of the Constitution to force a reform through Parliament without a vote, for the 100th time of the fifth Republic.

## Disinformation is used to divide and conquer

Villani left Macron and joined France's ecological party for the 2022 election. The second round opposed Le Pen (Rassemblement National) to Macron, leading to the creation of the New Union of Popular, Ecological and Social parties (NUPES).

A year later, Olivier Véran, Macron's Minister of Health appointed during the Covid-19 crisis, compares France social movement on March 7, to <i>"an ecological disaster"</i> 😷. Gérald Darmanin, Macron's Minister of the Interior, compares his opponents on the left wing to <i>"terrorists"</i>.

What does Macron try to hide ?

## Disinformation is used to divert attention

In an interview in le Monde, on March 28, 2018, the French Medal Fields [Cédric Villani](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/rapport-villani/) said <i>"AI cannot be a new machine to exclude"</i>.

With women representing 10% of French computer science engineering schools, Villani recommended an <i>"incentive policy"</i> aimed at achieving a rate of 40% of female students by 2020. As he wrote in his report, <i>"this lack of diversity can lead algorithms to reproduce biases"</i>.

Racism, sexism and social risks are mentioned in his 2018 report, as well as <i>"new methods of production and distribution of value"</i>. More broadly, the MP recommended the establishment of an AI ethics committee, responsible for organizing public debate and providing opinions and recommendations <i>"in complete independence"</i>. 

Yet, in 2023, Polytechnique alumnis' strategy is to disinform people. [This article](https://www.lajauneetlarouge.com/ia-de-confiance-enjeux-et-solutions-pour-un-traitement-ethique-des-donnees/) by Vincent LUCIANI (X05) explicitly highlights conflicts of interest (Consulting companies, Artefact, the AI Infrastructure Alliance, the MLOps Community, etc). Related articles by Alain (X79), Didier (X82), David (X97), Thierry (X84), Robert (X72), Gérard (X67), Paul... underline a lack of diversity at Polytechnique (all authors are white male, between 38 and 80 years old). 

I remember, at the time when I studied at Polytechnique, <i>"leaders"</i> were invited to inspire us. Carlos Ghosn was invited a few months before ending in prison. The French billionaire Patrick Drahi gave his name to Polytechnique's center for entrepreneurship and innovation, today he's publicly known for the [DrahiLeaks](https://www.blast-info.fr/articles/2023/drahileaks-la-methode-de-patrick-drahi-pour-devenir-riche-P5NfCE1qRt6QgwnJRKpMtA). Polytechnique's management [needed to be rectified](https://www.ccomptes.fr/system/files/2020-02/20200225-12-TomeI-ecole-polytechnique.pdf) the Court of Auditors wrote in 2020. What has been done since?

Six months earlier, in another interview in Le Monde in September 2017, Villani mentions Putin, law and revolution, talks about World War III and Elon Musk's business model. The privatization of AI research is mentionned, Yann Le Cun, Macron… Google, Amazon, Facebook, Europe, governance problems.

## The deeptech bubble bursted

Deep tech is promoted by Yann Le Cun (French godfather of AI), Cédric Labaye (President of Polytechnique), Bruno Le Maire (French minister of the Economy)… Emmanuel Macron.

The number of unicorns in France (startup valued a 1 billion plus euro) is a misleading KPI 🦄.

It creates more inequalities and puts at risk women and ethnic groups.

Bots and fake profiles could spread viral messages on social networks, but the artificially generated bubble started to burst. 

Silicon Valley Bank shut down in February 2023, five years after Villani's report. UBS to acquire the Crédit Suisse 🇨🇭.

People are disinformed in the short term, but a scientific principle never stays secret.

Disinformation and repression don't generate long term value.

## Why fact checking is outdated

- It is a probabilistic vision, outdated by quantum physics and the idea that two contradictory ideas can be true simulatenously.
- It is a binary vision, 0/1, true/false... [Some questions require to debate](https://www.blast-info.fr/articles/2023/sommes-nous-toujours-en-democratie-AwJ1_TmlTM-ONwHybrhuqQ). 
- Fact checking of viral messages diverts attention from key findings, like Emma Strubell's article [Energy and Policy Considerations for Deep Learning in NLP](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1355/) (ACL 2019, MIT Technology Review).
- Fact checking puts voices under silence. It paves the way to censorship. See [AFFAIRE AREVA / MAUREEN KEARNEY: RETOUR SUR UN SCANDALE D'ETAT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRyriD9iLZY&ab_channel=BLAST%2CLesouffledel%27info).

What don't we don't know to debate? What isn't transparent?

## Technology and Human intents

French medias and social networks are owned by billionaires. The Government is controlled by a [French Mafia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EveWWX3fB2M&ab_channel=BLAST%2CLesouffledel%27info). AI Research is owned by GAFAM and NVIDIA.

In game theory, if people seek to maximize their individual profit and perceive ecology as a cost rather than a value, nobody in the above groupe has an interest in seriously addressing  climate change.

{{< figure src="fact-checking/Lecun-disinformation.png" caption="Science is used to create disinformation, divert attention, divide and conquer in politics.">}}

Meta AI, Open AI… don't innovate. The same model since Google's 2017 paper <i>attention is all you need</i> is used and renamed, and reused and renamed, etc, consuming in 2022/2023 more energy at a higher price, as a competitive advantage with publicly funded French research.

An arxiv from 2019 shows written evidence Facebook offered a gift to Paul Michel (X13), a French polytechnicien at Carnegie Mellon, to miscommunicate on science at NeurIPS 2019.

Are state-of-the-art, outperforming, competitive models better for society? 

Certainly not.

The share of women in Maths in high school in France dropped below 1994 level under Macron (source: [L'étudiant](https://www.letudiant.fr/lycee/infographies-comment-la-reforme-du-lycee-penalise-les-filles.html)).

## Open review questions

Yann Le Cun and 7 polytechniciens trained <i>large language models</i> for Facebook during the Winter 2022/2023 energy and social crisis. 

{{< figure src="fact-checking/facebook-cifre.png">}}

The models <i>consumed a massive quantity of energy, responsible for the emission of carbon dioxide</i> (source: Arxiv). <i>They have billions of parameters, for billions of people</i> (source: Meta AI blog). <i>Risks and harms include the generation of harmful, offensive or biased content… incorrect information</i>. (source: Github Model Card).
- Why is the French CIFRE system used for Meta to compete with Elon Musk's ChatGPT ?
- Why are the energy consumption and models' risks/harms, leak, ethical concerns, not communicated clearly on Meta AI's blog or on social networks?
- Why does Meta AI use greenwashing techniques (e.g., smaller, smallest), in its research blog and on social networks (Linkedin, Twitter) ? 
- Why did Macron discreetly decorate Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk's SpaceX competitor, with the Legion d'Honneur in 2023?

People are misinformed.

## Call to Action

The World faces an economic, ecologic and social crisis, while recording historical climate events - record heatwaves in 2022, 32 days without rain in 2023 (source: Meteo France).

Macron made VivaTech his signature event 🦄.

Here's what you can do

1. Prepare and ask your questions for Vivatech (June 14–17).
2. Take a pause from social networks this Spring/Summer to take care of your physical and mental health 🎗️, and beloved, planet.
3. Stayed informed about [disinformation](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/c/desinformation/) on my course, regularly updated.
