## Introduction

The education, higher education and research sectors are going through a crisis in France (lack of qualified personnel, undervalued, unattractive professions, job insecurity, physical health, mental health of professionals and students). Some talk about the Stockholm syndrome while others see opportunities.

For technophiles convinced that a <i>tablet or application</i> can do 80% or even 100% of <i>a teacher</i>'s work, this is the opportunity to invest in digital technology, online lessons, remote learning, artificial intelligence algorithms like chatGPT which copy pastes Wikipedia...

For others, and in particular professionals in the field, in animation, education, higher education and research, it is the opportunity to<b>learn how to take care of the pedagogical relationship</b> and <b>give meaning to our teachings</b>.

The following educational resources consider intelligence as the ability to create meaning, penetrate a shared world and reorganize one's vision of the world, whether emotional, rational, intuitive, etc. They share a humanist, social and ecological vision of learning and can be useful for teaching, learning to manage difficult situations and strong emotions, but also for living well together, creating dynamics of mutual aid and solidarity, nourish motivation and strengthen cohesion.

These resources come largely from the training <i>Taking care of the pedagogical relationship</i> by [Angela Biancofiore](https://www.angela-biancofiore.net/), artist and professor at Paul Valéry University, head of the group of scientific interest [TEPCARE](https://tepcare.hypotheses.org/) on the theories and practices of care, whom I thank for her training last June, as well as Malika Geidel, ex-teacher, whom I thank for her reading recommendations on pedagogy and for hosting me as a WOOFER this summer :) Thanks also to Morgann Raillecove and Cécile Tessier Pillet for their reading recommendations in sociology and on the fear of math!
