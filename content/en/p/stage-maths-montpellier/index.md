## Introduction

La Paillade district, in Montpellier, is home to numerous young talents and stars, especially scientists. With the [GSC association](https://www.jeveuxaider.gouv.fr/organisations/4859-generations-solidaires-et-citoyennes) (G√©n√©rations Solidaires et Citoyennes), a "STAGE DE PR√â-RENTR√âE" for 2023-2024 is organized, for students from primary to high school and higher. The summer internship is an opportunity to effectively prepare for the start of the year, in a caring environment and a collective working atmosphere, in small groups. It allows young people to learn or study in a good mood, to help students in their difficulties, to restore their confidence and to support them by adapting to their needs.
