## May is a symbolic¬†month

In many countries around the world, May 1st is International Workers' Rights Day. It is a day of social action to celebrate the working class and highlight ongoing workers' rights issues.

This year, a historical movement is expected in France.

As social media users, many of us <b>work for free</b> for Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. This is a call to action to deactivate/delete these accounts for the month of May, starting May 1st and continuing into the French Spring üå∏ and Summer ‚òÄÔ∏è.

The issue at hand is not the technology itself, but the Human intents behind it, as well as what they represent and defend: capitalism, the patriarchy, disinformation, repression, and climate inaction.

<b>A definite or temporary pause</b>, for a day, a month or the Summer, can have <b>a huge impact</b> while requiring <b>a relatively low amount of effort</b> from each individual.

Indeed, on June 14‚Äì17th, Macron's signature event will take place: the Salon Vivatech. During this event, Zuckerberg and engineers, investors, people from around the world fly to Paris to pitch/invest in technical gadgets and unicorns (startups valued at a billion plus dollars) ü¶Ñ.

Deleting Facebook/Instagram and other viral social networks is the strongest signal that can be sent to Macron and Zuckerberg for Vivatech 2023.

So, as a user and "worker" for these social network corporations, what are some good reasons to take a short (or long) break starting this May Day¬†?

## 1. Facebook leads patriarcal capitalism

Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other viral social networks generate profits from Uber Eats and Zalando ads.

They make us passive consumers rather than active citizens.

They concentrate trillions in capital in the hands of a few men and as a consequence deepen gender inequalities.

<b>All of this power comes from our personal data.</b>

Taking a break (or quitting) and convincing others to do the same is the maximum we can do as individuals. However, <b>this ripple effect can be enough to bring them down</b>.

As a plus, quitting social media usually gifts us with a fair amount of free time, which we can invest in tackling social and environmental issues, or reimagining the kind of world we want to live in.

## 2. Facebook fuels hate, disinformation and repression

The idea that social networks promote communication is a myth.

<b>We are inundated and overwhelmed with information</b>, greenwashing and conflicts of interest.

Human biases are reinforced by Machine Learning algorithms.

Opinions are misrepresented.

Some voices are silenced, people kept in the shadow.

Viral social networks help political figures to <i>divide and conquer</i>.

Laure Delisle, a colleague at Element AI, published an article at NeurIPS in 2018 with Amnesty International [quantifying the abuse directed against female journalists and politicians on Twitter](https://aiforsocialgood.github.io/2018/pdfs/track1/19_aisg_neurips2018.pdf).

Why do those who work for these companies educate their kids to stay away from these platforms?

Look around and ask yourself: do Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, Twitter and viral social networks really help with communication and debate?

## 3. It is time to take care¬†üéóÔ∏è

After three years of sanitary, energetic, political, ecological and social crisis, it is time to <b>take care of ourselves, of our mental and physical health</b>, of our loved ones and planet Earth.

We need to stop procrastinating, isolating ourselves and destigmatize addictions, depression‚Ä¶

[Facebook knows Instagram is toxic for teen girls](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039?mod=bigtop-breadcrumb). Its own in-depth research shows a significant teen mental-health issue that Facebook plays down in public (Wall Street Journal, 2021). According to the company's document:
- 40% of users that find themselves unattractive believe that it is particularly related to Instagram.
- 32% of young girls said Instagram made them feel even worse about themselves.

We need to truely (re)connect with ourselves and each other, and <b>refocus attention in society</b>.

We need to act in solidarity, support those around us, locally, in our neighborhood, and <b>create safe spaces for emotions</b>.

I deleted my account on Linkedin/Instagram after receiving an explosion of phishing attacks, following an alert I shared with my network in February/March.

I decided to take care of my mental health, and have more time and energy now to <b>help others free their mind and attention</b>.

## 4. It is time to anticipate, not¬†react

As a member of parliament clearly stated in an interview with [Blast media](https://www.blast-info.fr/emissions/2022/les-revelations-dune-deputee-au-coeur-du-systeme-macron-avec-frederique-dumas-9VNRlqrPSdaQKULTrvie5A), Macron struggles to anticipate because of a lack of vision.

My experience working as a consultant for the Government (SGDSN), to prepare France to major crisis, confirms this MP's observation.

Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin's algorithms and politicians' posts are optimised to generate reactions.

Viral posts serve their business, not your future.

So the next time you see toxic data, don't comment, share or react.

Simply deactivate/delete your account and <b>learn to invest your time and energy in the long term</b>: [learn a language](https://www.mtpcours.fr/en/p/language-learning/), learn to cook, do crafts, arts, sports, play music, volunteer‚Ä¶ rewrite the future with <b>new narratives</b> and a Summer in solidarity.

## 5. Alternatives exist

Alternative methods exist depending on your needs and usage.

<b>To stay informed and learn pro-actively</b>, I would recommend independant medias like Blast, scientific channels like M√©t√©o France and the CNRS, or the local press.

<b>To stay connected and communicate</b>, regular phone calls, sms or a walk and talk work fine.

[Framasoft](https://framasoft.org/en/), a French non profit, also offers a suite of alternatives to Facebook like Mobilizon.

Finally, non profits and clubs (sport, art, etc) give the opportunity to meet people in your <b>local network</b>, sharing the same interests.

## 6. An increasing number of people have already¬†quit

People in France have already started to take the ACTION of deleting their Tiktok, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or Linkedin accounts during the Spring üå∏.

Many students in humanities and ecology I spoke to have already deleted Tiktok because they felt they were having attention issues and struggled to concentrate.

<b>High school and university students</b> with whom I spoke, as well as <b>women in science, healthcare and parents</b> are supportive and ready to take the challenge in May.

What about you?
